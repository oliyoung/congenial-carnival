# AI Integration Layer

This directory contains the AI-powered features that enhance the wisegrowth coaching platform with intelligent insights, automated summaries, and personalized training recommendations. The AI system is designed to support coaches, trainers, and mentors in making data-driven decisions while helping athletes develop better self-reflection skills.

## Core Philosophy

The AI integration follows the platform's **human-centered coaching approach** that:
- **Augments rather than replaces** coach expertise and judgment - AI acts as a coach's assistant, not a replacement
- **Turns conversations into progress** by extracting meaningful insights from session transcripts and notes
- **Adapts to different developmental stages** - especially youth athletes who need guided reflection
- **Maintains data privacy and security** with all processing respecting athlete confidentiality
- **Provides actionable insights** rather than generic analysis
- **Scales with the coaching workflow** from individual sessions to long-term development patterns
- **Builds truly personalized development journeys** by understanding context over time

## Platform Context

**wisegrowth** is designed for coaches, trainers, and support professionals who want more than spreadsheets and sticky notes. The platform addresses the core problem of fragmented coaching systems where:
- Critical context from past conversations is lost
- Progress isn't easy to see across time
- Planning the next step takes more time than the session itself
- Coaches struggle to identify recurring patterns and potential risks
- Goal refinement and progress tracking lack structure

The AI layer transforms these challenges into opportunities by providing intelligent support for the coaching relationship.

## Four Main AI Pillars
