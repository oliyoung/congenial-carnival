# CoachCraft Dashboard: Workflow Integration

## Dashboard as Coaching Command Center
When coaches log in, they see their **athlete dashboard with summary of all athletes, recent activity, and quick actions** - but framed as **"Your Coaching Wins Today"** rather than just data. The hero section guides them to the most important athlete needing attention.

## Seamless Athlete Journey Navigation
The action card **"Time to build Sarah's next training plan"** directly connects to navigating to **athlete profile pages (`/athletes/[id]`)** where coaches review athlete details, tags, and progress - but positioned as **"Understanding Sarah's Story"** rather than administrative review.

## Goal Management as Growth Tracking
The secondary sections include **"Goals Reaching Milestones"** which flows into **viewing and managing goals for each athlete** - but reframed as **celebrating progress** and **identifying next growth opportunities** rather than just editing/tracking.

## AI-Powered Session Intelligence
**"Plans Ready for Review"** represents the **AI tools for session summarization, next-step generation, and progress analysis** - but positioned as **your intelligent coaching assistant** providing suggestions rather than automated outputs.

## Training Plan Creation as Mentored Experience
The main CTA **"Build Sarah's Next Plan"** leads into **creating and managing structured training plans** - but guided by AI mentorship that links plans to athletes, goals, and session logs through supportive prompts rather than complex forms.

## Future Team Coaching Vision
The **"Your Coaching Growth"** section hints at the planned **team management features** - showing progression toward managing multiple athletes and potentially collaborating with other coaches.

**The key difference:** Every workflow feels like **guided coaching development** rather than software task completion.
