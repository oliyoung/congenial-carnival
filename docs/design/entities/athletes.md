The visual design for Athletes should prioritize their name and primary goal with a clear visualization of their "distance" from achieving it, using celebratory progress indicators that feel like journey milestones rather than clinical metrics.

Each athlete card should have its own color personality and emotional context that reflects whether they're ahead, on track, or need extra support.

The design should make coaches excited to engage with each athlete's story of growth, not just review their data.

Each athlete's color story should reflect their current goal journey stage - from fresh pastels for "Just Starting Out" to vibrant, confident tones for "Peak Performance" - with colors that gradually evolve and intensify as they progress, creating visual storytelling where coaches can literally see the growth journey in the color evolution.
