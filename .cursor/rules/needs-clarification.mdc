# Areas Needing Clarification

Based on the current understanding of the congenial-carnival project, the following areas still require further definition or documentation as development progresses:

1.  **Specific Feature Prioritization and Detailed Roadmap:** The exact order and scope of the next features to be built are being determined.

2.  **CI/CD Setup and Requirements:** Plans for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are a "TODO" and not yet defined.

3.  **Detailed Error Handling, Logging, and Monitoring Conventions:** Specific patterns, tools, or requirements for logging, monitoring, and handling errors throughout the application haven't been detailed.

4.  **Specific Plans for Future Third-Party Integrations:** Details, providers, or integration patterns for planned integrations like calendaring and live chat (or other potential services) are not yet known.

5.  **Release Management Strategy:** How and when new versions of the application will be built, tagged, and deployed (versioning, release cadence, etc.) is not defined.

6.  **Detailed Requirements for Future User Roles:** Specific permissions, capabilities, and flows for planned "Client" and "Admin" roles are not yet known.

7.  **Complex Seed Data Requirements:** While initial seeding is possible, requirements for more complex or scenario-specific seed data might evolve.

8.  **Contributor Contact/Support Information:** How contributors should seek help, ask questions, or submit work (e.g., preferred communication channels, code review process) is not specified.

As these areas become defined, they should be documented, preferably in `@context.mdc` or a dedicated document in the `/docs` directory, and this list should be updated accordingly.
