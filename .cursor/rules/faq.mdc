# FAQ

## Who is torchlight for?
torchlight is built for people who support growth in others: coaches, athletic trainers, mentors, and support professionals. If you work with athletes over time and want a clearer view of their progress, torchlight is for you.

## What can I do with torchlight?
- Track athlete goals, sessions, and milestones in one place
- Capture session notes or transcripts and tag key takeaways
- Link sessions to goals and see progress over time
- Use built-in AI to summarize sessions or generate next steps
- Keep your coaching process organized and flexible

## How does the AI help?
torchlight includes optional tools that help you:
- Summarize coaching sessions
- Generate personalized training or development plans
- Spot recurring themes or roadblocks across sessions
- Refine goals and make them more actionable
- Automatically identify key takeaways and action items from sessions
- Suggest relevant AI prompts based on athlete context
- Proactively flag potential athlete risks or roadblocks

The AI stays in the backgroundâ€”you're always in control.

## What formats of session data can I use?
You can type notes directly, paste in a transcript, or upload audio for transcription (coming soon). All of this is linked to the athlete's profile and active goals.

## Is this just for athletic coaches?
Not at all. While torchlight supports athletic training, it's equally useful for executive coaching, creative mentorship, academic advising, or any other long-term support role.

## Is athlete data secure?
Yes. torchlight uses encryption at rest and in transit. We follow best practices for handling personal data, and we're committed to transparency and control for both coaches and athletes.
