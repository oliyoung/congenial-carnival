# Internal Product Narrative (Working Backwards Style)

## Who is the customer?
Coaches, trainers, and mentors who support athletes over time and want better systems for capturing insight, planning growth, and measuring outcomes.

## What is the customer problem or opportunity?
Coaches are stuck between unstructured tools (like Google Docs) and rigid systems (like spreadsheets or CRMs). They want a flexible workspace that understands how real growth happens—through repeated conversations, evolving goals, and context that builds over time.

## What is the most important customer benefit?
A single place to see the arc of an athlete's development—linking notes, goals, sessions, and reflections—with optional AI tools that speed up planning, deepen insight, extract key takeaways, and proactively identify potential challenges.

## How do you know what customers need?
User interviews with coaches and support professionals revealed:
- Difficulty tracking goal evolution over time
- Fragmentation across too many tools
- Time wasted summarizing sessions or rewriting plans
- A desire for intelligent support without giving up control
- The need for help in refining goals and identifying actionable steps
- Challenges in spotting recurring patterns and potential risks early

## What does the customer experience look like?
- Coach logs in and sees their athlete dashboard
- Clicks into a session, adds notes, or uploads a transcript
- AI extracts key takeaways and suggests action items from the session
- Tags the goal it supports and sees updated progress, potentially refined with AI assistance
- Uses the AI helper to generate a draft of next week's plan or analyze progress for recurring themes
- Reviews AI-suggested prompts or potential athlete risks
- Moves to the next athlete with confidence and clarity

## What makes this product different?
- Built from the ground up for the coaching relationship
- Combines freeform note-taking with structured goal-tracking
- AI acts as a coach's assistant, not a replacement—helping refine goals, extract insights, analyze themes, and flag risks
- Designed for growth over time—not just task management
