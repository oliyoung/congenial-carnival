Today, we're excited to announce the launch of wisegrowth, a new application designed for coaches, trainers, and support professionals who want more than spreadsheets and sticky notes. wisegrowth transforms how progress is captured, tracked, and improved—combining thoughtful UX, structured data, and cutting-edge language models to build truly personalized development journeys.

Whether you're coaching athletes, mentoring leaders, or supporting athletes through long-term change, wisegrowth helps you move from scattered notes to structured outcomes.

### Customer Quote
"I used to rely on notebooks and my memory to track where athletes were at—and I always felt like I was missing something. wisegrowth gives me a clean way to capture session notes, revisit long-term goals, and even get an AI summary of the big themes. It's like having a second brain for coaching."
— Casey Tran, Athletic Performance Coach

### The Problem
Many coaches and trainers operate in fragmented systems—paper journals, unstructured Google Docs, and generic CRMs. Critical context from past conversations is lost. Progress isn't easy to see, and planning the next step often takes more time than the session itself.

Coaches also struggle to refine goals effectively, extract key takeaways from dense notes, identify subtle recurring patterns, and proactively spot potential athlete risks before they become major roadblocks.

There's no single tool that understands coaching work as a continuous, human-centered process—until now.
