Today, we're excited to announce the launch of Torchlight, a new application designed for coaches, trainers, and support professionals who want more than spreadsheets and sticky notes. Torchlight transforms how progress is captured, tracked, and improved—combining thoughtful UX, structured data, and cutting-edge language models to build truly personalized development journeys.

Whether you're coaching athletes, mentoring leaders, or supporting clients through long-term change, Torchlight helps you move from scattered notes to structured outcomes.

### Customer Quote
"I used to rely on notebooks and my memory to track where clients were at—and I always felt like I was missing something. Torchlight gives me a clean way to capture session notes, revisit long-term goals, and even get an AI summary of the big themes. It's like having a second brain for coaching."
— Casey Tran, Athletic Performance Coach

### The Problem
Many coaches and trainers operate in fragmented systems—paper journals, unstructured Google Docs, and generic CRMs. Critical context from past conversations is lost. Progress isn't easy to see, and planning the next step often takes more time than the session itself.

There's no single tool that understands coaching work as a continuous, human-centered process—until now.
